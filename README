Update history
--------------
v1.0 (2009.12.24 Xmas env. for fun) Jimmy Liang

1. Using Jquery to make javascript simpler.
2. Using background.html to read google bookmarks' xml. popup only retrieve data from background, no need read from internet. User can click "Reload" any time needed.
3. On the popup, use: setTimeout("LoadBookmark",500); to show popup immediately. Advoided popup freezed like some other bookmark extensions.
4. Add an "ALL" label on the end of the labels to show all bookmarks together, for easier to find and find out reduplicate bookmarks.
5. Add a loading indicator.
6. Auto ajust div to show bookmarks and scroll.

TODO(maybe):
-----------
1. edit bookmark in popup?
2. need Login in popup? or not?
3. batch move bookmarks to other label?
4. batch delete bookmarks.
5. more level of labels in the format: aa/bb/cc ?
6. chrome itself's bookmark sync function maybe better...
