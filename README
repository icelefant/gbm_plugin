1. Using Jquery to make javascript simpler.
2. Using background.html to read google bookmarks' xml. popup only retrieve data from background, no need read from internet. User can click "Reload" any time needed.
3. Add an "ALL" label on the end of the labels to show all bookmarks together, for easier to find and find out reduplicate bookmarks.
4. Add a loading indicator.
5. Auto ajust div to show bookmarks and scroll.

TODO(maybe):
-----------
1. edit bookmark in popup?
2. need Login in popup? or not?
3. batch move bookmarks to other label?
4. more level of labels in the format: aa/bb/cc ?
chrome itself's bookmark sync function maybe better...
